# osu! bpm calc

this script calculates bpm for weird snaps. useful for like 1/5.5 or idk.

## the formula:

`new bpm = original bpm * [desired snap] / 4`

(example: 183 bpm for a 5.5 snap gives 251.625 bpm)

**note:** always stay on 1/4 snap in your osu! editor when applying the new bpm.

## how to run:

just open the `osu_bpm_calc.exe` file.

## how to use:

1.  original bpm: hit "load from .osu" to get it from your beatmap file.
2.  desired snap: type your snap number (like `5.5`).
3.  hit "calculate & copy". new bpm shows up and gets copied to your clipboard.
